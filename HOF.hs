-- USING MAP

-- GHCi> map reverse ["dog","cat", "moose"]
-- ["god","tac","esoom"]
-- GHCi> map head ["dog","cat", "moose"]
-- "dcm"
-- GHCi> map (take 4) ["pumpkin","pie","peanut butter"]

-- FOLDING A LIST

-- The function foldl (the l stands for left, which weâ€™ll explain soon) takes a list and reduces it to a single value. 
-- The function takes three arguments: a binary function, an initial value, and a list. 
-- The most common use of foldl is to sum a list:

-- GHCi> foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]
-- 10

myProduct :: (Foldable t, Num b) => t b -> b
myProduct xs = foldl (*) 1 xs

myFoldl :: (t -> a -> t) -> t -> [a] -> t
myFoldl f init [] = init
myFoldl f init (x:xs) = myFoldl f newInit xs
  where newInit = f init x


myFoldr :: (t1 -> t2 -> t2) -> t2 -> [t1] -> t2

-- GHCi> foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]

-- GHCi> foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]

-- But for subtraction, order does matter:
