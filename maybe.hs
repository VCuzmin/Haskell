isJust and isNothing
-- The Data.Maybe module contains two functions, isJust and isNothing, that solve the general case of handling Just values. 
-- isJust is identical to the isSomething function but works on all Maybe types. 
-- With Data.Maybe imported, you couldâ€™ve solved this problem as follows:

justTheOrgans' = filter isJust availableOrgans
