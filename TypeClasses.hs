-- You have to implement only two methods: the Equals method (==) and the Not Equals method (/=). 
-- Given how smart Haskell has been so far, this should seem like more work than makes sense. 
-- After all, if you know the definition of (==), the definition of (/=) is not (==). 
-- Sure, there may be some exceptions to this, but it seems that in the vast majority of cases, if you know either one, then you can determine the other.

-- It turns out that Haskell is smart enough to figure this out. 
-- Type classes can have default implementations of methods. 
-- If you define (==), Haskell can figure out what (/=) means without any help.
